gbpSID is a library that provides some general functionality to C/C++ projects.  

Namely:

* Facilities for writing clean-and-clear log output with optional timing information
* MPI wrappers permitting MPI code to be compiled without MPI for running in parallel
* Some simple routines for efficient reading/writting of flat binary files
